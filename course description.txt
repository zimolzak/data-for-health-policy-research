how to conduct research on de-identified electronic health record data and secondary analysis. We are finding that students express interest in policy topics that require some retrospective chart review research and do not have in-house faculty who routinely conduct these analyses.

 Course Description & Learning Objectives: 

 This elective, the third in a series of four in the Health Policy Pathway, is designed to introduce students to major methodologies used in health policy scholarship and prepare students for a capstone research project in their fourth elective, MEETH 419. Students will be required to have taken MEETH 413 and MEETH 414 prior to this course so they will have a fundamental understanding of health policy. Ultimately, it is the students who enter this course that are committed to completing the Pathway. In this course we will systematically approach policy analysis through frameworks the primary methods used in analysis. Over 2 weeks, students will have required interactive sessions- workshops and method-based immersions. While students will be exposed to multiple methods for policy analysis, a focus will be on landscape analysis as this will be the formal policy analytic method we recommend they use in MEETH 419.

Learning Objectives

Goal: To provide students with a framework to critically examine health policy and to integrate methodologies into a preliminary research question for their capstone project.

Objective 1: Appraise various state, local, and hospital policies using an analytic framework and experiential learning.

Objective 2: Apply a methodology and analysis to assess a real-world policy question.

 
Learning Activities:

A two-week course with 40 hours of faculty facilitated time.

a. Didactive/interactive learning, with flipped coursework outside of class b. Experiential roundtables: two structured practicums with policy professionals c. Faculty facilitated reflections on readings and experiences d. Final policy analysis proposal developed over the two weeks
