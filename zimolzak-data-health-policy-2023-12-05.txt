What is *Clinical research informatics?*

- I make various clinical research studies "go," using existing data.
- "Phenotyping" using electronic health record (EHR) data




## A detailed reference about secondary use[^mit]

![](book.jpg){ height=75% }

[^mit]: MIT Critical Data. *Secondary Analysis of Electronic Health Records.*
Springer Cham, 2016. [Click for free access](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-43742-2)




## How I (an informatics person) look at these studies

- database type
- whose data?
- "pre" methods (how carefully did they do "phenotyping"?)
- study type (broadly)
- ...and oh yes, the details of "real" analysis methods and results






# 1: Medicaid expansion affects VA utilizatiton[^pom]

[^pom]: O'Mahen PN, Petersen LA. Effects of State-level Medicaid Expansion on
Veterans Health Administration Dual Enrollment and Utilization:
Potential Implications for Future Coverage Expansions. *Med Care.*
2020;58(6):526--533. [PMID 32205790](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32205790/)




## Methods

### Data

- EHR (plus)
- VA & Medicaid, 1999--2006
- pre methods tk

### Analytic

- difference-in-difference analysis
- exposure: Medicaid expansion (NY and AZ in 2001)
- endpoints: dual enrollment, hospital admissions, ED visits




## Results

- dual enroll tk
- hospital admit tk
- ED visits tk

### Bottom line

Great example of a study that measured the **effect of a policy** on
several outcome variables derived from the EHR.




# 2: Measuring delayed opioid dispensing[^kao]

[^kao]: Chua KP, Waljee JF, Smith MA, Bahl S, Nalliah RP, Brummett CM.
Estimation of the Prevalence of Delayed Dispensing Among Opioid
Prescriptions From US Surgeons and Dentists. *JAMA Netw Open.*
2022;5(5):e2214311. [PMID 35622363](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35622363/)




## Methods

Delayed dispensing:
: Dispensing > 30 days after writing: possibly used for unintended reasons/dates.

### Data

- deidentified prescription writing, fill date, *etc.* (not EHR)
- IQVIA Formulary Impact Analyzer ($\approx$ 63% of US Rx), 2014--2019
- legal databases too (NABPLAW, Westlaw Edge)
- pre methods tk

### Analytic

- descriptive
- difference-in-difference analysis
- exposure: Change in Minnesota law, July 2019
- endpoint: % of delayed opioid dispensing




## Technical

$\mathbb{E}(Y_{ist}) = \beta_1 \mathsf{State}_s + \beta_2
\mathsf{Month}_t + \beta_3 \mathsf{Minnesota}_{ist} \mathsf{Post}_{ist}$

tk: move me to end?



## Effect of change in policy

![Minnesota $0.55 \to 0.13$%, *vs.* controls $1.12 \to 0.97$](kao-graph.jpg){ height=75% }




## Results

- endpoint tk

### Bottom line

tk




# 3: An electronic measure of diagnostic quality[^drm]

electronic clinical quality measures to assess the cancer diagnostic
process. *J Am Med Inform Assoc.* 2023;30(9):1526--1531. [PMID

# 4: Detecting wrong-side imaging tests[^she]

Remediation of Misidentification Errors in Radiology Examination
Ordering. *Appl Clin Inform.* 2020;11(1):7--87.
[PMID 31995835](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31995835/)

## Results quote

> These findings raise questions about the reliability of staff
> adherence to departmental guidelines in faithful checklist
> performance and spreadsheet completion, and again raise suspicion of
> potential workarounds.

- Consider: not "imperfect staff" but "imperfect policy?"
- Or, avoid "blame game" altogether


# Summary and advice




## Summary of studies I presented

### Medicaid expansion

**Data:** EHR + Medicaid. **Question:** state policy $\to$ utilization.

### Delayed dispensing

**Data:** Prescribing + legal. **Question:** state policy $\to$ practice pattern.

### Electronic quality measure

**Data:** EHR. **Question:** measure development and validation.
*But:* novel measure $\to$ a policy incentivizing improvements? Or:
new policy $\to$ effect on this measure?

### Sheehan

**Data:** Internal spreadsheet + EHR. **Question:**  *local* policy $\to$ its
intended effect. (Measuring staff adherence to an *existing
departmental* policy)




## VA data overview[^fihn]

- 20 million individuals
- 2 billion outpatient visits
- etc tk

[^fihn]: Fihn *et al. Health Affairs* 33:1203 (2014)




## "Just search" for your data

sodium[^nate]

[^nate]: Fillmore, N., *et al.* Interactive Machine Learning for
Laboratory Data Integration. *Stud Health Technol* 264, 133--137.




## "Just do"

A1c




## Statins

confound by indication



## Statin

slide 2+ on this




## It takes a long time

- datathon example
- know that datathon exists
- Amgen example of phenotyping
- actual manual chart review is a thing. Hard work; get *different aspects*


## what's in EHR data

- list

Probably need assistance



## EHR data $\ne$ EHR data

### Data just among Houston BCM affiliates

- Baylor St.\ Luke's $\subset$ St.\ Luke's Health $\subset$ CommonSpirit
- Baylor Clinic
- Harris Health
- TCH
- DeBakey VA Med.\ Center $\subset$ VA

### The problems

- VA $\ne$ Epic
- $\mathsf{Epic}_1 \approx \mathsf{Epic}_2$
- $\mathsf{VA}_1 \approx \mathsf{VA}_2$ (yes, really)
- $\mathsf{OMOP(VA)} \approx \mathsf{OMOP(Epic)}$



## Benefits of EHR data for research

- lot of it




# How policy *affects research*

## actual hipaa

- safe harbor



## "Fancy anonymization"

- Dwork



## Getting access



## Examples of deident EHR

- mimic


## Adapting a meme from 2019, if I may

::: incremental

- Me, a clinical informatician, hiding under the bed:
- Armed robber: \ldots
- Me: \ldots
- Armed robber: \ldots.
- Me: \ldots.
- Armed robber: It's easy to deidentify medical record data. Just remove all identifiers.
- Me: WHAT, CAN YOUR ANALYSIS DEAL WITH ONLY YEAR? DO YOU HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE INFORMATION COULD BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER INFORMATION FOR REIDENTIFICATION? HAVE YOU COUNTED HOW MANY 3-DIGIT ZIP CODES CONTAIN FEWER---uh oh.

:::


## Research data/code sharing

- sadly uncommon
- journals have policies
- NIH has policies




# A bit about "AI"

## definition

- super broad
- we've had AI for decades

## stats vs ml

hastie

## choice quotes

- "unfortunate trend"
- "false dichotomy between statistics and ML"

> dichotomy enables

## Maarten 3/16

> call it prediction model

## Maarten 6/21

> the statistics vs machine




## Chat bots

"Sutskever [chief OpenAI scientist] was shocked at the reaction to ChatGPT.  He noticed three main phenomena which disturbed him greatly."

1. A number of practising psychiatrists believed that ChatGPT could grow into an almost completely automatic form of psychotherapy.

2. Users very quickly became emotionally involved---Sutskever's secretary demanded to be left alone with the program, for example.

3. Some people believed that the program demonstrated a general solution to the problem of computer understanding of natural language.




## WHOOPS, that was 1976, not 2022![^eliza]

**Weizenbaum** was shocked at the reaction to **ELIZA.**  He noticed three main phenomena which disturbed him greatly.

1. "A number of practising psychiatrists seriously believed the DOCTOR computer program could grow into a nearly completely automatic form of psychotherapy."

2. "I was startled to see how quickly and how very deeply people coversing with DOCTOR became emotionally involved\ldots."

3. "...a belief that it demonstrated a general solution to the problem of computer understanding of natural language."

[^eliza]: Weizenbaum, J. 1976. *Computer Power & Human Reason.* W.H. Freeman & Co.
